This project has two parts. 
1. Image Recognition and Analysis
2. Language Translation 

###Image Recognition: 
  This part helps to get features and the things that might go unnoticed by many people. Here it takes Image URL as input, after submitting it is sent to analyze where we can get details such as name, background colour, dominant colors, objects category, image description and summary. 
Also we can use this to generate Title for the image with added features to the project.

###Translation: 
  This part take english text as input and prints hindi translated text. For this we have used translate component of the MS Azure Cognitive Services. This helps those peoples who want a exact hindi translation of the english statement.

####  The entire Application is mainly focused on making efficient use of Microsoft Azure and mainly its Cognitive Services.

####  The application is hosted on Internet through Azure Static Web App. The URL to the same can be found at the top. Also attaching here,

The description of building the project loically is given below.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
