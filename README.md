This project has two parts. 
1. Image Recognition and Analysis
2. Language Translation 

## Image Recognition

  This part helps to get features and the things that might go unnoticed by many people.  We have used the `**Computer Vision**` component of the `**MS Azure Cognitive Services**`. Here it takes the Image URL as an input, after submitting it is sent to analyze where we can get details such as name, background colour, dominant colours, objects category, image description and summary. 
Also, we can use this to generate a Title for the image with added features to the project.

## Translation

  This part takes English text as input and prints Hindi-translated text. We have used  the `**Translator component**` of the `**MS Azure Cognitive Services**`. This helps people who want an exact Hindi translation of the English statement.
 
## Web Hosting

  The application is hosted online through `**Azure Static Web App**`. The URL to the same can be found at the top. Also attaching here,

## Azure Services Used
1. Azure Cognitive Services
2. Azure Image-Recognition
3. Azure Language Translation
4. Azure Static Web App

  The entire Application is mainly focused on efficiently using Microsoft Azure and its Cognitive Services.

### The description of building the project logically is given below.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

## Development server Web Hosting

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artefacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. You'll first need to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities to use this command.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
